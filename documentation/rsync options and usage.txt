USE CASES

Note for all examples below:
    SOURCE OR TARGET can include prefix of [USER@]HOST:
        But both can't be foreign hosts.

MOVE ALL FILES IN A DIRECORY TO A DIRECTORY, OVERWRITING AS NECESSARY
        Recursively: Yes (or drop -r)
        Conflicts: Overwrite files in conflict, but do not delete files in TARGET not in SOURCE
            DOES NOT OVERWRITE newer files in TARGET.
        Source: The source directory is deleted entirely IF rsync succeeds
        Verbosity: -v and --progress make it chatty.
    rsync -avuE --progress "$SOURCE"/* "$TARGET" && rm -r "$SOURCE"
