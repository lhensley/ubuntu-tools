Daemons vs Services
Ref: https://askubuntu.com/questions/192058/what-is-technical-difference-between-daemon-service-and-process#:~:text=The%20word%20daemon%20for%20denoting,is%20what%20a%20server%20provides.
Simple Example & Overview: https://medium.com/@benmorel/creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6
	.service files go in /etc/systemd/system directory (or /lib/systemd/system ?)

Lane Services ("unit files")
	Developed and stored in $GIT_GO_SERVICES
	upd script copies them to $SERVICES_DIR ("/lib/systemd/system")


Pull up any unit file from the $GIT_GO_SERVICES (services) directory. They're easy to adapt. Things you'll need to specify:
	Description
	Executable
	User/Group Running the Executable

	Start and test
		sudo systemctl start SERVICE_NAME
		sudo systemctl status SERVICE_NAME

	Enable (have it automatically start on bootup) (Creates a symlink to the .service file in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants)
		sudo systemctl enable SERVICE_NAME

To Create a Service

#####################

Create a script in the sbin directory. 
The needs to run constantly unless there is a critical error or the program is stopped with systemctl.
Boilerplate code for that:

	# Do stuff here
		while true; do                                   # Repeat forever
			echo "This is a line of code."               # Sample program execution
			echo Sleeping at $(date) for 10 minutes      # Announce that you're sleeping
			sleep 10m                                    # This is the amount of time between iterations to keep from killing the CPU
			done
		done


Sync to Github and run "sudo upd" to copy it onto a server. Test it.

Once the testing is completed, do these things:

Add this code to the script prior to the "Do stuff here" section:

	# "Run as a service" check
		if [ "$PPID" != "1" ]; then
			f_die "This script only runs as a systemd service. Try sudo systemctl start $(basename $0)" false
			fi
		SERVICE_FLAG=true;

Copy one of the files in the services directory so it has the same name as the script you wrote, with a ".service" suffix.

Edit that file to adapt it to the new program.

Sync to Github and run "sudo upd" to copy it onto a server.

To run the program as a service on a given server, use
	sudo install-service [service-name]

To start the service on the server, use
	sudo systemctl start [service-name]

To check the status of the service, use
	sudo systemctl status [service-name]

To remove the program as a service on a given server, use
	sudo remove-service [service-name]
