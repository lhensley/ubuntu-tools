# To Back Up
Connect a peripheral hard drive 1TB or more for the "live" backups
*  Define it in fstab to mount manually only.
*  Keep it unmounted when not in use.
*  Figure out a rolling purge of old data

"Live" backups happen by rsync
* Once done, use tar to compress an archive version
* If feasible, rsync live backups off-site
* If feasible, store archives on same drive as "live" backups
* Giant file systems (e.g., Plex data) get rsync mirroring, but not archiving

Consider mounting the hugest file systems (bertha, rerun, 5TBA, 5TBB)
  as read-only, and make them readable only when they're being edited.
  Use a "work" volume to store recent adds.
